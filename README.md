# Zigbee-Pattern-of-Life

ZigBee is a low-cost, low-power wireless protocol (IEEE 802.15.4) that is becoming increasingly popular in IOT and home automation markets.  Given the wide reliance throughout the home, commercial, and energy sectors on ZigBee technology, the significance of ensuring the security and privacy of this protocol cannot be overstated. Pattern of life traffic will be collected from ZigBee devices, analyzed via internally developed software, and used to identify privacy and security vulnerabilities.
